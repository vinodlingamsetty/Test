INSTRUCTIONS
=================

- You are to create an iOS Mobile application that looks and functions as specified in the wireframe.pdf
- A partially completed starter project (IOSProgrammerTest) is supplied to help you get started.
- There are 4 main sections in the mobile app: Home, Chat, Login, and Animation Test.
- Please take care of the bug(s) we left for you in the starter project as well.
- For all intents and purposes, you now own the starter project code, you can add, remove, or edit any code as you see fit.

=================
APP SECTIONS
=================

- Home: This is a very simple screen, all it does is have buttons that lead you to the other screen in the app.

- Chat: This section simply displays a list of an old chat log from some cached data, however the user images in the chat
must be dynamically downloaded from the provided urls.

- Login: This is your typical mobile app's login screen, where a user enters their credentials and attempts to login. Details
on what HTTP Endpoint to query and what the UI should do upon a successful login are specified inside the wireframe.pdf

- Animation Test: The basic requirements for this screen is that when the spin button is tapped
the AppPartner logo rotates 360 degrees Counter-Clockwise once every time the spin button is tapped. The use must also be able to tap and drag the
icon around the screen. After fulfilling those requirements, try to show us something cool on this screen! Maybe after you tap the spin button some music starts playing, and a crazy light show start happening around on the screen. Maybe the AppPartner icon explodes if I drag it around too much, almost anything is fair game here, be creative and impress us!
